Let's try a variation on the temperature converter.Let's try a variation on the temperature converter.
Then the increment step fahr = fahr + 20 is executed, and the condition re-evaluated.Then the increment step fahr = fahr + 20 is executed, and the condition re-evaluated.
As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ``.c''
Computation in the temperature conversion program begins with the assignment statements lower = 0; upper = 300; step = 20; which set the variables to their initial values
#include <stdio.h> /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300 */ main() { int fahr, celsius; int lower, upper, step; lower = 0; /* lower limit of temperature scale */ upper = 300; /* upper limit */ step = 20; /* step size */ fahr = lower; while (fahr <= upper) { celsius = 5 * (fahr-32) / 9; printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius); fahr = fahr + step; } }
To compile the C code "hello.c" on the Linux operating system, you can use the command "cc hello.c" in the terminal. This command invokes the C compiler to process the source code file "hello.c" and generate the executable output.
The function main contains only one statement, printf("hello, world\n"); A function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of arguments, so this calls the function printf with the argument "hello, world\n"
Our aim is to show the essential elements of the language in real programs, but without getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptionS
This approach and its drawbacks
Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0
That is, after c = getchar(); the variable c contains the next character of input
The statement ++nc; presents a new operator, ++, which means increment by one
One of the nice things about while and for is that they test at the top of the loop, before proceeding with the body
The switch statement, to be discussed in Chapter 4, provides another way to write a multi-way branch that is particulary suitable when the condition is whether some integer or character expression matches one of a set of constants
When the name of an array is used as an argument, the value passed to the function is the location or address of the beginning of the array - there is no copying of array elements
