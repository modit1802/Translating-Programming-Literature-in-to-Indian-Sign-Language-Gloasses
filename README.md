**Translating Programming Literature into Indian Sign Language (ISL) Glosses**
This project aims to convert English sentences into Indian Sign Language (ISL) glosses while preserving C programming language syntax and keywords, such as a.out, .c extensions, and other programming-specific terms.
To enhance user experience, we've developed a web application using Flask. 
_**The application allows users to input text and receive the following outputs:**_

1. English Sentence
2. Hindi Translation
3. Indian Sign Language (ISL) Gloss
This solution bridges the gap in accessibility by ensuring programming literature is more inclusive and understandable for individuals relying on ISL.

**üì¶ Features**
Accurate ISL Gloss Translation: Converts English sentences into Indian Sign Language (ISL) glosses while preserving the structure and meaning of programming-related content.
C Programming Keywords Preservation: Retains essential C programming keywords, such as a.out, .c, and other syntax elements, without altering their context.
Multilingual Support: Provides translations in English, Hindi, and ISL Gloss, making it accessible to a wider audience.
User-Friendly Web Interface: Developed using Flask, offering an intuitive and seamless user experience for text input and output display.
Real-Time Results: Instant processing of user input to generate corresponding translations and ISL glosses.
Scalable and Modular Design: Built with flexibility to accommodate future enhancements and additional language support.
